# C-Switch
A simple project to turn on/off defines in a C header file quickly. This project is based on PigCore using sokol_gfx.h and sokol_app.h to make a graphical window.

# Usage
1. Run quick_switch.exe
2. Select File->Open from the top bar
3. Choose a C header file (.h) that has some number of #define lines that are set to "1" or "0"
4. After opening, a button for each #define in the file will be shown.
5. Clicking a button will toggle the value between 1 and 0 (and immediately write to the file)
