# C-Switch
A simple project to turn on/off defines in a C header file quickly. This project is based on [PigCore](https://github.com/PiggybankStudios/PigCore), it uses [sokol_gfx.h](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/sokol_gfx.h) and [sokol_app.h](https://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/master/sokol_app.h) to make a graphical window, and [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay) to do UI layout.

# Usage
1. Run cswitch.exe
2. Select File->Open from the top bar
3. Choose a C header file (.h) that has some number of #define lines that are set to values like `1`, `0`, `true`, or `false` (value-less `#define`s will also work, they will be commented/uncommented)
4. After opening, a button for each `#define` in the file will be shown.
5. Clicking a button will toggle the value between 1 and 0, or true and false (and immediately write to the file)
